Lists: Lists are used to list out certain items either ordered or unordered.

some lists have order and some don't.
In HTML, lists are classified as 3 types
  i. ordered list : ordered lists are used to list out certain items in an order
      HTML uses 'ol' tag for ordered lists
      Inside ol, each list item denoted by 'li' tag
    <ol>
       <li></li>
    </ol>
  we can mention any type in 1(numbers-default), A,B,i(roman-lowercase),I(roman uppercase) using 'type'
  we can even start at any point using numberical attribute 'start'
  one list inside another list is called 'nestedLists'
