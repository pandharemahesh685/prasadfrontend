--------------------------- HTML -------------------------------------------------------------------
 HTML started by Tim Berner's Lee in 1989 at cern.HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)  is used to define the structure of the website. In html, everything is mentioned as elements. Each element will tags and content
eg:
<human>
I'm a human
</human>
// try to create an element superhuman with some content
<superhuman> Good boy!! </superhuman>

HTML code always between html element and html element contains head and body elements
head is used for meta-data
body is used for content

 ** HTML is not case sensitive

--- title element defines the title of web page and will be inside head
--- VSCode Provides shortcuts called "emmets"
--- emmets to create basic html template are !+enter (or) html:5+enter

We can write comments in HTML within <!-- and -->. These comments are helpful to make code more readable


1. headings and Paragraph:
headings are used to make any text as important and each heading holds its respective importance. There are 6 headings possible in HTML i.e., h1 to h6 where size and importance decreases when heading number increases
<h1>gdgfdsj</h1>   ---  most important and biggest one
-
-
-
<h6>fbvm</h6>   -- least important and smallest one
2.Paragraph: p tag is used to display paragraph.
<p>para</p>
To get default paragraph , we can use 'lorem' emmet

3.HyperLinks: These links are used to navigate the user into different addresses/references.
These links are generated by anchor tag. anchor tag denoted with 'a'
Eg:<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>

We can even keep one element inside another element called as "nested elements".
eg: <p> for more content like,share and subsctibe <a href="https://facebook.com">fb</a></p>

we can even navigate to mail using 'mailto:mailid' or telephone using 'tel:number' or watsapp using 'wa.me/number'

To open anchor links in new tab , we use attribute target and set value = "_blank"
eg:<a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_target">click for w3schools</a>


4. Images: Images are used for visual creatives in webpage.we can use 'img' tag to display images in the web page

But img is a self closing tag. self closing tags are the tags which do not have closed tags. They will be written like
<open tag> or <open tag />. These tags also called void elements or unpaired tags or empty elements

img have following attributes
  src -- used to keep links/path of images source
  alt -- it describes alternative text for image and it works only when src is not works
  height -- used to mention height of the image
  width -- used to mention width of the image
