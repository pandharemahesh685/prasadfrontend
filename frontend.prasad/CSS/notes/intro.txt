CSS(Cascading style sheets): These files are used to design/style the web page
They were introduced in 1994.The current version of CSS is CSS3
There are 3 types of CSS:
  i. inline CSS:
  inline CSS will be applied to any HTML element with 'style'
  as a attribute
  eg:<h1 style="background-color: black; color: white;">Hello Everyone</h1>
  ii. internal CSS:
  internal CSS will be applied to any element or elements with 'style'
  as an element
  <style>
     selector
     {
      //poperties
     }
  </style>
 It is not mandatory to write style element in head, but it will help better performance and SEO
  iii. external CSS:
  external CSS will be applied to any element or anyelements as a separate file with '.css' extension
you have to link with 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

inline is the most powerful and between internal and external it depends on the latest one


Basic Selectors:
 1. tag selector:
 tag selectors selects all the elements of that tag name
eg: h1{

}
  2. class name:
  class name is used to select multiple elements with same class name, if we are using classname, it preceeds with dot
  .classname

  3. idname:
  id's are used to select any element uniquely and it preceeds with hash(#)
  #id

if i want to overcome any css priority !important for any property

!important > inline >internal/external(id>class>tag)


To Understand Design well, we need to master few basics:
i. units
ii. colors
iii. fonts


i. units: units defines the size metrics.
  a.px  --- pixels are the smallest unit of screen but they are not responsive
  b.vh,vw --- viewport height,viewport width-- they are used to assign units according to screen
  c.% -- percentage is used to provide some x % of its parent
  d. em -- enumerated value -- it takes x times of parents font size
  e. rem -- root enumerated value -- it takes always root font size(16px)


2. colors:
   Different colors represnts different meanings. color is part of the brand.
   we can assign color with multiple properties such as background-color and color in different variations
     i.name: we can specify colors by name;
     ii. hexcode: every color will be represented by a hexadecimal code
    iii. rgb(r,g,b): each value ranges from 0 to 255
     rgba(r,g,b,alpha): it brings different shades of single color. 0.0 is the lowest and 1.0 is the highest
    iv. hsl(hue,saturation,lightness): hue is the degree from 0-360.
    saturation: % of darkness
    lightness: % of lighness
    we can also use hsla
you can also specify multiple colors called gradients.
background: linear-gradient(color1,color2...)
or
background:radial-gradient(color1,color2....)
linear gradient show colors transform in horizontal or vertical direction and radial gradient shows in circular

iii. fonts: fonts represents the brand. we use different font styles to express different goals
there are 5 different font families exist
  i. serif: serif fonts are used for documentations because they have stroke at end of every character
    Eg: Times New Roman
  ii. sans-serif:serif fonts are used for unofficial docs  because they do not  have stroke at end of every character
  iii. monospace: they have same space between each character and same height
  iv. fantasy: these are new fonts created
  v.   cursive: cursive letters are combined ones
