float: left/right/none;

clear: To clear out values from left/right of floated elements, we can use property 'clear'
clear: left/right/both.

we can even make elements(block) side by side using 'float'

display:  display is used to arrange elements 'display' property, either as 'block'/'inline'/inline-block'/none

block is to make elements block such that they will not come side by side

inline-block is used to make elements with height /width and inline
none is used to remove the element
