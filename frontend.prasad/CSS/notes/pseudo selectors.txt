We can select an element using multiple ways
i. tag name : eg: h1
ii. class name : eg: .classname
iii. id name: eg: #idname
iv. immediate child: eg: div>p(p who is direct child of div)
v. descendant child: eg: div p(p who is descendent of div)
vi. attribute selector: eg: input[type="text"]
vii.immediate sibling selector(+):
eg: h1+p( p which comes after h1)

Pseudo selector: Pseudo selectors selects elements based on its position or state.

   :hover: hover will be applied when user puts mouse over the element
   :required: it will select all inputs which are required
   :optional: it will select all inputs which are not required
   :readonly: it will select all inputs which are readonly

   :last-child: selects the last child with the selector
   :nth-child(number): selects element with specific numbered child
   :nth-last-child(number):selects element with specific numbered child from last
