Transition: transition means moving from one state to another state.
You can control transition of an element by 'transition' property.
transition: property time(s) timingFunction
property: provide which property to show transition or 'all'
time(duration): time in seconds or milliseconds
timingFunction: it defines the speed in which element moves from one state to another state

there are so many properties which can be applied for nice
 transition effects

transform: scale()--- Zoom
           rotate() -- rotation
           translateX() -- move horizontally
           translateY() -- move vertically

filter: none/grayscale/contrast/drop-shadow/brightness/blur/hue-rotate()

clip-path:none/circle/ellipse/polygon

animation: animation is nothing but element moves from one state to another stages via multiple states , simple it is multiple transitions

animation-name: name of the animation
animation-duration: time in s or ms of animation
animation-timingFunction: function to decide how animation runs(ease/easeIn/easeOut/easeInOut/linear)
animation-delay: time to delay the animation before it starts in s or ms
animation-direction: decides which direction animation should run(normal/reverse/alternate/alternateReverse)
animation-iteration-count:number of times animate to repeat

we need to define animations using @keyframes where each and every state of animation will be defined
0% - starting- from
100% - ending - to
Time is considered for percentage
