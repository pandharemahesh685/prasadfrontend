A design or web page should be responsive means it should lookfit to the every device
Types of devices
   i. laptop: min-width:1280 max-width:1440px
   ii. desktop: 990px to 1279px
   iii. tablets: 776px to 997px
   iv. mobiles: <776px

   it is not necessary to divide exact sizes but using css we can treat each screen separetely

   @media Queries:
    it is used to define a certain range and "css" written inside media queries will be applied to only specified criteria
    Eg: h1{
        background-color:red;
    }
   @media(max-width:576px){
    h1{
       background-color:blue; 
    }
   }

it means until 576px h1 bg color will be blue , later it is red normally
Tips: 
always try flex and grid
never allow more spaces using paddings/margin
use em,rem,%,vw,vh insteaad of px
always use media queries at the end of file
try different bgs for different devices
